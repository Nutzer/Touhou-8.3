Problems with THcrap

the big problem with THcrap is, that it only features
replacing of recources in the "th**.dat" (file for images, scripts, dialogs, sound effects e.t.c)

But for what I'm doing, I need to replace in "thbgm.dat" (Background Music file) and "th**.exe" (You should now what this does) too.
So I am forced to use another way to change the data of it.

And that means...

...that you have to download additional data
I prepared a tool for you that changes your normal Touhou 14.3 to Touhou 8.3 and back.
just place it in your Touhou 14.3 directory
ATTENTION: While patching, the program downloads a lot of data (~700 MB), so, be ready for it
https://www.dropbox.com/s/01enn86mv63347y/Data.zip?dl=0

if you don't like the programm, you can download a patched th143.exe and th83bgm.dat here: Data.zip (~700MB)
https://www.dropbox.com/s/bqbb148t7v12m5t/Touhou%208.3%20Tool.exe?dl=0


And which data of the game changes it?

Changes in Th143.exe:
-changes the used thbgm.dat
-changes the directory the scorefile, scene pictures, configs and Logs are saved in
(Starts a New Game without Deleting your old Th143 scores)

Changes in Th83bgm.dat:
-changes bgm songs

Thcrap changes in Th143.dat:
-Changes Stage, dialog and image scripts
-Changes images
-Changes Sound effects


Troubleshooting:





I have no custom music.
	

Try to download and run the patching tool.
if it has an error, try the patched download






the program crashes on Startup.
	

Maybe the patching tool was interrupted while download.
did you got a message that the patching is completed after running it?

If that doesn't is the case, make shure that you don't changed anything in the scripts.
if it continues, reinstall the thcrap patch







the program crashes when I start a scence.
	

This mainly means that the programmer (Me) programmed this sceance very loosly and doesn't checked it enough.

if this happens, just start the scene again til it works
(and, if you want, send me which it was at reztun@hotmail.de)





the program crashes randomly.
	

this can not be prevented.
just start the program again





some of the images are not patched.
	

make sure that you run ONLY this patch.
using it with other patches will cause this.






My problem is not listened above.
	

report it to reztun@outlook.de
I will check it
