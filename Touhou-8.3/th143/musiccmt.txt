        Title Theme
Author's Comment:
　キャラと曲が結びつかないゲームなので、
　一般的な戦闘曲みたいなのになりました。
　ステージの長さと曲の長さが釣り合い取れないのは
　何度もリトライすることが前提だからです。

					Sector 1 + 2 Theme
  A naive rearrange of my first attempt at Rin Satsuki's theme.
  Does it sound better now? 
  I really don't have talent for this. :/
  
  It sounds a little too low, I might re-upload a clearer version.

　Author's comment:
短いフレーズをクドく使い回した単純な曲です。
最初はゲーム曲のつもりでしたが、やりたい事を詰め込みすぎて、
到底ゲームでは使えない変な曲になりました(笑)
